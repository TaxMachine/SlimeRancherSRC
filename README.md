# Slime Rancher "Source Code"

This is the source code for Slime Rancher, Monomi Park's award-winning, open-world
sandbox game for the Playstation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

## Why is this here?

Mainly for modding purposes. I was kinda bored and decided to upload this to GitHub
for the sake of it. I'm not sure if this is allowed, but I'm doing it anyway.

## How do I compile this?

You can't. This is just the source code. You can't compile it. You can't run it.
